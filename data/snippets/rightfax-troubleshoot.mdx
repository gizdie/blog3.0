Hopefully this might help someone else troubleshoot Rigthfax problems that I have come across but was not able to find the answer
on the internet and or get the proper help from Rightfax support.


### Sync-Module Not Auto Syncing
I was having a problem with syncing an active directory group and would get this error message every time. The error message would 
show up in the event viewer and or when you run the debug for the syne module.

```
Error while 'RF - QUALITY' was processing 'D:\Program Files (x86)\RightFax\CapaSync\Incoming\AdSync_230718180425.xml'.
RightFax.Api.Common.RFApi32+Exception: The user or object does not exist. (-9903)
   at RightFax.Server.Sync.RightFaxPlugin.RightFaxTask.ConnectToRightFaxServer(String strServer, RightFaxCredentials cred)
   at RightFax.Server.Sync.RightFaxPlugin.RightFaxTask.DoDestinationSync(String strFile, String strSchema, Int32& iNumUsersSynced)
   at RightFax.Server.Sync.CoreProcess.StartDestinationSync(Profile destination, ScheduledItem schedule, String strInFile)
```

At the end of the day the fix is very easy and made sense, however not even Rightfax support was able to figure this out after doing 
a remote screen share and taking over the server.

The fix is to make sure that the service account that you use for Rightfax is also a user within Rightfax its self.

### How To Manually Sync the Sync Module
Open the settings for the AD config you want to sync. Check the box to "Also schedule a sync after control panel is closed".

Click ok and then apply. Before you hit ok on the Sync Module Configuration you want to hit cancel after hitting apply. At 
this point the Sync Module should turn red and say "interactive or stopped". Right click on the Sync Module and select Debug.
This will run the sync job manually and will give you a log.
