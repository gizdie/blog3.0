## The P1S Printer
I got tired of messing with the Ender 3 Pro and decided to buy the Bambu P1S printer with the AMS. I will use this "snippets" page for 
updates on prints I do.

### House Plant
This print turned out really well. The leaves can be used as drink coasters but i'm mostly using it for looks. I used liquid shoe polish as
a brush on for the trunk to add some texture to the wood.

### Hard Drive Clock
This is a working hard drive clock. It uses the bambu clock components kit-MH011.
