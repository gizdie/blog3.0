## Recent Personal Projects

**vSphere with Docker Environment**

At home I have setup a vSphere server running various virtual machines for different types of tools.
Some of these tools include a Plex server, Docker running Portainer, TrueNAS. vSphere is a great tool
to use at home to explore and learn skills that will relate to my actual career. I'm moving to Proxmox 
due to VMware changing pricing/free model.

**Personal Next.js Website**

I enjoy coding on the side and have written many things in different languages like
Python, .net,  and recently Next.js. Although I do not code in my career life, 
it’s a very useful tool to help understand how software/tools work in the real world. 
One day I would love to switch my career to DevOps.
