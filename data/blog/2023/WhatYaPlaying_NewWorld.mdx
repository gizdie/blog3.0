### What I Have Been Playing
Recently my video game playing has been a bit all over the place. 
I struggle to find something I really enjoy and I miss playing a good shooting FPS. 
My game ADD has really set in. I'm holding my breath for Starfield which comes out 
next month, which im hoping will be the next Skyrim and keep me busy for a good while.

So below is a list of what I have been playing and or what I have been dablling in.

### New World
I really really enjoy New World, the combat system, aniamations, art, spells, skills, 
everything. However the major problem for me is end game New World doesnt seem to have 
anything to make you feel you are... progressing. They add new content once in a while
 but where is the progression? Most of the time progression of armor and weapons is just roll of a loot dice for a .005% chance to get something useful. 

I miss the days of WoW (but I cant go back to that game, too old) type gameplay where there 
is a BIS item a dugeon but you might need to do the dugeon 20 times to get that one peice. 
None of that really exists in New World and if it does the item you want is not BIS at all.

### Diablo 4
I played the shit out of Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 in the 1990s and I played Diablo 3 when it came 
out but I don't think 3 has as much charm as the old ones. Diablo 4 is pretty fun, I just havnt 
gotten into the mood fully for it. I need to finish the story part so I can progress to the next 
"level" of difficulty to get the "real" drops. I suspect I will keep playing Diablo 4 on and off. 
Also I want to add i'm ok with the slowness of Diablo 4 unlike Diablo 3 where shit was just 
flying all over the screen at lighting speed.


### Palia Beta
I got into the game beta of Palia which is what I would describe as a Stardew valley meets Farmville.
 Its a "mmo" but ehhhh not really just a few people you see in town here and there.

### Starfield
All I can say about Starfield is that I'm excited for this game and can't wait for it. 
I just hope it does not disapoint!

### Magic The Gathering
My childhood friends got me into playing Magic the Gathering back when we were in 7th grade. So naturally those same
friends are trying to get me into playing again. This time Magic the Gathering commander decks. I'm not a huge fan of 
the commander game type as it's more complicated than I remember and liked the more randomness of making a 40 card deck
that you need to prefect. Either way we are giving it a go here and there.
