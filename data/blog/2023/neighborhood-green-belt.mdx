I'm pretty sure this "green belt" is really just a service area for a major sewer pipeline that runs behind the hospital and 
connects to some other parts of neighborhoods in the area. There are no signs saying your not allowed to walk in this area and its 
not even really fenced off. It gets mowed maybe once a year and I have never seen anyone else walk in it. It's most defiantly an
area that is not meant for people to walk freely on. I can see major sewer and other pipelines underground along this green belt
and also running along side it is a small stream.


## Trash & Old Tables
The whole area and stream is full of trash. I'm assuming blown in from the streets, maybe teens do go back there and hang out?
I'm considering one of these days making a trip down the green belt with gloves and bags to pick up trash, something I have done
in my neighborhood before. It’s a good walk/work out and just keeps the place clean. I'll need to get ahold of some sort of cart
to pull with me and pick up trash to take home. Once I figure out to do that one-day I’ll post an update.

Across the street from this green belt is a really nice park that is hidden and doesn’t see too much activity. The same stream winds 
through this park as well. I really like the ambiance of the park, makes it seem closed off with 3 walls and safe.

This is some trash of broken pipes, footballs, etc. that maybe was thrown over from the school.

There are some old tables that obviously are not used anymore. I'm assuming the school used to go into this green belt along time ago.
