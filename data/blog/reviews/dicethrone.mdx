This is a fast-paced battle card game that can be played with 2 players up to 6 players. 
 Each game package comes with 2 different characters of defined class, and each character 
 set varies in difficulty to play. The game developers suggest to start with the set that 
 includes the Barbarian and Moon Elf, as they are the easiser classes to understand.

Each class has their own unique abilities that can debuff other players or buff themselves.
 Damage is determined by rolling dice and matching the dice with an ability your character has. You 
 can also upgrade abilities with cards you get each turn. Active card abilities with combat points
 gained each round.

We have only played the Barbarian and Moon Elf set so far, but there may be more battles to come.
 We saw more game packages on sale at our local Barnes and Noble store. There might be another set 
 purchased soon.

The game retails for about $20 on Amazon.

**Other notes:**
- Packaging is top notch - the box contains mini-boxes for each character and their 
  game accesories (dice/cards/character board)
- The rule book is colorful and instructive
- The artwork for the game is fun and appealing
