### Year 2025

This coming year i'm looking forward to some great camping trips and hopfully new responsibilities at work. I have
taken over some of the duties of a database administrator that has retired, and have currently been doing their work
for a few months already. Hopfully this will come with an offical title or some sort of change. Either way DBA work is a 
great skill for me to have under my belt. I have some knowledge already of SQL and database work but now i'm actually 
doing the work.

Currently I have been playing STALKER 2 and Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen. Pantheon is a "new" old school type MMO, 
taking the shape of 90% Ever Quest and 10% of WoW. My friend and I are currently enjoying the game but it is in 
early access so we will see where it goes this year.

### Reflect on 2024
I started a Hobonichi Techo journal early in 2024 and tried to keep up with journaling, keeping dates, and other every day things.
Hobonichi journals are my new favorite notebook since it includes daily pages for journaling, a full monthly calandar,
lists, and few other pages. It's also almost pocket size (A6). 

Now i'm starting with a new 2025 Techo journal and look forward to making my doodles and working on some of my "art".
You might start seeing my doodles on my blog. I figure it's an easy way to have icons/images that are not copy right 
or stolen. Adds some personal character to my site as well right?
