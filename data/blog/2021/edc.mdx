No matter if I goto the grocery store (pretending there is no COVID 10 and that I actually
do go to the grocery store right now) or just going to work. I don't mention the mask 
that in the cover picture, but as of right now I always have an extra one shoved in my pocket.


### Bellroy Wallet
I will start with the most important item, which is my wallet. I use a Bell Roy Hide and Seek 
Wallet. The leather feels good and it is the right size for me to hold all my cards. Its even RFID 
protected if you worry about that sort of thing. [Company Link](https://bellroy.com/products/hide-and-seek-wallet?color=caramel&gclid=Cj0KCQiAlsv_BRDtARIsAHMGVSa_ihCd6MQMhMekb3SHbMJwSrm_ypDWhgi2xmWSvm0pHFGAM0rVFUYaAlf5EALw_wcB&material=leather_rfid&size=hi#slide-0)

### Spyderco Knife
Next up is my pocket knife. This little dude is a Spyderco Delica 4 2.8" blade. 
Just my normal pocket knife that cuts boxes for me or what ever I need it for out 
in the woods. I can't find the exact model I have but the link should be very close 
to the same. [Company Link](https://www.spyderco.com/catalog/details/C11FK390/1885)

### Apple Watch
This one is a given. Its my Apple Watch Series 5. Track my running, hiking, every 
day what ever. I use it for calls, timers, meeting notices. It also seems to hold 
up on a 3 day hiking trip in the woods so long as I bring a battery pack to charge 
it at night. [Company Link](http://www.apple.com)

### Fisher Bullet Pen
The Fisher Bullet Space Pen is a decent small pen to keep in your pocket when you 
need to write something down. Never know when you will be in space! Any of the bullet 
pens are nice, take your pick of design. [Company Link](https://www.spacepen.com/bullet.aspx)

### Blank Forces
This pen I don't always carry in my pocket but I normally have it in my backpack. 
Its very expensive which is why it doesn't always go all places with me. Super awesome 
custom pen how ever. Sleek and I like the size and smoothness it feels in my hand.

### iPhone
Last but not least is my iPhone 11 Pro. It's my phone of choice, use it for pictures 
and 4k video. I have the 128gb size which is plenty for what I use it for. The case is a 
Pitaka MagEz case. I use these cases for all my apple products. They have a good grip and 
stick to my magnetic car holder well. [Company Link](https://www.apple.com)
