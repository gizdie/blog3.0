summary: I bought a Bambu Labs 3d Printer and been having an awesome time printing everything with it. It's a major upgrade from the Ender 3 Pro and works better than I expected.

## The Start

The Bambu Labs P1S 3D Printer has made 3D printing a piece of cake and makes all my Ender 3 Pro days
seem like a joke. The days of trying to make sure the Enders bed is level and checking a print job everything
five minutes to make sure something has not gone wrong are all gone! The Ender served its purpose and it 
was still a great beginers 3D printer for the price it was (less than $200).

Out of the box it worked and I was printing in about 15 minutes. I have a feeling I will be running out of
filament very often with this printer.

More complicated prints don't seem to have a problem with the P1S. There are alot of larger prints that have
over hangs that would be printing in thin air (which does not work well on 3D printers) and they can be
complicated with supports and wasteful if the print job fails. I'm still learning with this printer but I 
have tested a more complicated print which was a full size skull mask for my face. I plan to use it for a
Halloween costume.

I think I will start a "snippets" page for 3D printing and post projects I do there going forward.
