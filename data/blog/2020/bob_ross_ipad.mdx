I decided to give a go at painting a Bob Ross scene on my iPad Pro. I'm using the application
Procreate on ipadOS and followed a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/XwByi3_RM5I) I found on youtube.
Trying to do oil type painting on the iPad is not the most easy process but Procreate can do a pretty
good job at imitating it. I don't know of a way to mix paint colors like Bob Ross does to make a different
color. It's my first painting every so not too bad I think. The trees look a little... off.

I did a time laspe video of me doing the paiting on my iPad.
