Hey peeps. I wanted to talk about games i'm currently playing and what I kind of rate them on how much fun i'm having with them. I'm playing games across a few different platforms. Mostly PC games and Nintendo Switch games but I also am part of a Dungeons and Dragons group that plays every other Sunday.
Animal Crossing: New Horizons 
Let's start with Animal Crossing. I have been playing New Horizons since launch day and I do love these type of "sim" games. Love playing this game just for a short period everyday to progress my "life" and make some bells! I may not be the most creative person playing Animal Crossing but my little town is getting there. I'm playing the turnip stock market with some friends so making sure I sell on the right day and right island.

### Deep Rock Galactic
I bought this game maybe a year ago and I started playing it again with a friend. 
This game is awesome. Has my favorite type of system of collecting and unlocking 
new things with some action packed alien bug killing. I think it keeps me going 
because altho you are doing the same thing over and over for the most part... 
the levels are randomly generated so doesn't really seem the same. Because you 
unlock near gear and weapons it also keeps me going because I can use something 
different and it will provide a different game play feeling. Not to mention 4 
different classes to play. I'm mostly play either the engineer or the scout.

### Astroneer
I started playing Astroneer again. Theres is a new update with dedicated server 
option so I am going to attempt to get that working so I don't have to be on for 
my friends to play as well. Astroneer is another relaxing, easy going game to just
chill with. Explore the world, find materials, build a base. I might report back on 
this once I get the server going.
	 
### Minecraft Dungeons

I bought Minecraft Dungeons on Switch with the plan on maybe playing it on PC when 
they figure out the cross platform playing/saves. I enjoy the game so fa, however I 
don't think it goes very far in game depth. It was only $20... It's a fun Diablo style 
game that makes things way more simple which I enjoy. I don't have to worry about being
 a complete bad ass to get any where in the game. Minecraft Dungeons I can just hop on 
 here and there and play without feeling completely left out.

### Ever Quest 2

A friend and gave EQ2 (free) a try. I never played Ever Quest at all so I thought I would 
give it a try. I used to play Asheron's Call back in the 90s which I also just got a 
dedicated server working for AC on a virtual machine a few weeks ago. I figured if I ever 
really want to play old AC again I can just load up that VM and play. Regardless EQ2 didn't 
last more than a few days of playing for now, it doesn't keep our interest because it's such 
an old game.

### Command & Conquer Remastered

C&C Remastered comes out this Friday! I'm going to dive into that with a friend and bring 
back what started a lot of PC gaming for me. I may have steered away from strategy games 
over the years but I wouldn't mind playing C&C in HD again. I will report back on how awesome 
it turns out to be.

### Missed And Completed Games

I have a problem. It's not a drinking problem... but a gaming problem. I buy too many games
 and never finish them. I get bored, or a new game comes out that I can't resist and want to 
 play it so then it takes over. Either way, here are some games I want to finish or get back 
 to playing.

- Zelda Breath of the Wild (On Going)
- Dying Light (Completed)
- Elder Scrolls Online (On Going)
- Skyrim (On Going) - Started playing this again on Switch
- Divinity 2 (On Going) - Buddy of mine and me started this coop game. Need to finish.
