incomplete But shews The Isle Of the Serpent In far off Lemuria\n\n**Chuck:** \nWhere rests A fabulous Treasure Called the Feathered crown Of Nenasa\n\n**Chuck:** \nOr at least That's what The Ixian

You had Pretty pleasant Sailing\n\n**Chuck:** \nWhat's also Interesting Is The weather Warmed up\n\n**Chuck:** \nA lot\n\n**Chuck:** \nAlmost Immediately As you As you Entered The remnant And you Went

Unusual Place\n\n**Chuck:** \nThe Most Of The Most Of The Educated Think That's Because Of The Incredible Science And Sorcery Of The Ancient Lemurians\n\n**Sarah:** \nUm\n\n**Chuck:** \nBut Um As As

Lemurians And Girl Lemurians\n\n**Chuck:** \nYes But They Both Have Beards\n\n**Chuck:** \nUm\n\n**Dave:** \nOf course\n\n**Chuck:** \nThere's The The City Lemurians Who Are Very Civilized\n\n**Chuck:** \nWell Educated\n\n**Chuck:** \nAnd Then There Are The Jungle Lemurians\n\n**Chuck:** \nUh Who Are Typically Referred To As The Linyit\n\n**Dave:** \nUm And They Are A lot More Barbaric\n\n**Chuck:** \nUh At Least From The Perspective of\n\n**Jackie:** \nThe city\n\n**Chuck:** \nYeah Living A Civilized City Life\n\n**Chuck:** \nBut They Live In Small In Small Villages More In The Jungle\n\n**Chuck:** \nAnd Are Responsible For Hunting\n\n**Chuck:** \nUm For Uh Gathering Resources Out Of The Jungle Itself\n\n**Chuck:** \nFor raising dinosaurs and training them\n\n**Chuck:** \nOne Of The Linyit  Village Headmen\n\n**Chuck:** \nHis name Is Guntan\n\n**Chuck:** \nUm\n\n**Chuck:** \nHis Daughter Kaori Was One Of The Settlers That Went To The Isle Of The Serpent\n\n**Chuck:** \nAnd He In Particular Wants To Hire You To Go Find them\n\n**Hali:** \nHe Was Looking For People Who Were Brave Enough To Um To Go Find Out What Happened To The Settlers\n\n**Chuck:** \nAnd Uh You Guys Were The Only Ones Who Were Stupid, er uh,  Powerful Enough To Uh To Actually Go There\n\n**Chuck:** \nAnd He Is Willing However To Uh To Take Well To Provide Transportation To The Isle Of The Serpent\n\n**Chuck:** \nBut Um His His Villagers Are Not Up To Exploring The Jungle Or Whatever It's Going To Take To Figure Out Where They Went\n\n**Chuck:** \nSo It's Going To Be Kind Of A Drop Off And Then We'll Be Back To Get You Maybe\n\n**Sarah:** \nIf You Show Up\n\n**Chuck:** \nAnd That's About Where Where We We Left Off\n\n**Chuck:** \nUm You Know\n\n**Chuck:** \nWell You Have A Map\n\n**Dave:** \nYou Have A Map Of The The Isle That You Bought From The\n\n**Rusty:** \nFrom FedEx\n\n**Dave:** \nWell The The Eskimeaux Slave Apparently Worked At FedEx\n\n**Sarah:** \nI’m Surprised The Eskimeaux’s Name Wasn't Yut’tah\n\n**Sarah:** \nYeah There We Go\n\n**Chuck:** \nSo You Have Very Little Information About The Island\n\n**Chuck:** \nI Just Hope You Didn't Pay Too Much For This Map\n\n**Sarah:** \nJust Most Of Our Life Savings\n\n**Chuck:** \nI Mean I Paid About Five Bucks For This Map\n\n**Chuck:** \nBut This Is What You Know About The Island\n\n**Dave:** \nSurrounded By Water\n\n**Chuck:** \nThat You Definitely Know\n\n**Chuck:** \nSince Dave Probably Can't Read It From Down There\n\n**Chuck:** \nUp Here In The Northeast Corner It Says Something About Long Necked Sea Monsters\n\n**Chuck:** \nDown Here It Says Skiff Foundered All Hands Lost\n\n**Chuck:** \nOn On The Northwest Side It Says Maelstrom\n\n**Dave:** \nWind\n\n**Chuck:** \nAnd On The Southern Side It Says Vast Swamps Many Flying Reptiles\n\n**Dave:** \nWhich Is Where All Of The Nopes Are\n\n**Chuck:** \nGuntan Doesn't Know Exactly Where Their Settlement Is\n\n**Chuck:** \nBut Kaori Had Told Him And Mogun When You Know When He Was Discussing It Had Said That They Were Planning On On Settling On The West Side Of The Island\n\n**Jackie:** \nOn The West\n\n**Chuck:** \nYeah\n\n**Chuck:** \nSo I Think You Have A Few Days Before Your Armor Is Going To Be Adjusted Right\n\n**Dave:** \nI Believe At Some Point We Were Talking About Going To Some Kind Of Temple But Then We Decided It Was Too far Away\n\n**Hali:** \nSo I Think We Did Go To Darug Darug Darugan Darugan Darugan Temple \n\n**Hali:** \nThat Was The Last Stop Before We Went Into The Jungle\n\n**Hali:** \nAnd Gave An Offering\n\n**Hali:** \nAnd Then I Did Have A Note That The Boetsu Temple Bless The Expedition\n\n**Chuck:** \nOkay\n\n**Dave:** \nBut Uh Not a lot Of Good That Did\n\n**Jackie:** \nI Was To The North No One Goes To The Other Temple\n\n**Jackie:** \nAnd See what Is My Daughter Kaori\n\n**Jackie:** \nFelt She Could Make A Good Life There\n\n**Jackie:** \nThe Leader Of Expedition I Said\n\n**Jackie:** \nPriest Yeah Priest From The Temple Bless The Boats\n\n**Jackie:** \nWe Stay The Night\n\n**Jackie:** \nSo Where Do You Want Us To Start?\n\n**Jackie:** \nBack At The Port Or At Guntan's Village\n\n**Chuck:** \nThat's Up To Y'all\n\n**Chuck:** \nWhat Do You Want To Do?\n\n**Chuck:** \nI Mean You're Going To Have To Go Back To The Town To Get Supplies\n\n**Chuck:** \nIf Assuming That You Can't Just Live Off The Land\n\n**Chuck:** \nMaybe You Can Just Live Off The Land\n\n**Chuck:** \nBut You'll Probably Want Some Supplies Anyway\n\n**Chuck:** \nUm So Yeah You You Talked About Going To The Zoan Monastery\n\n**Chuck:** \nBut That Was That Was Going To Be Quite A Journey\n\n**Hali:** \nUp Up Up The Mountain\n\n**Chuck:** \nSo I Mean You Can Still Do That If You Want\n\n**Jackie:** \nWhat Would Be the Purpose of going Up there?\n\n**Jackie:** \nSo That\n\n**Dave:** \nGetting in over our heads\n\n**Chuck:** \nAsh Could Find Some Other Monks\n\n**Dave:** \nSo If You Find These Other Monks Are They Like An Army That You Can Bring With You\n\n**Chuck:** \nProbably Not\n\n**Chuck:** \nAll Right So What Do Y'all Want To Do\n\n**Hali:** \nWe Should Get Supplies Before We Do Anything Else\n\n**Jackie:** \nOne Of My Abilities Is General Classification Of Plants\n\n**Jackie:** \nEven Though I Haven't Ever Seen These Types Of Plants Or You Know The Grasses That Are Around Beaches And Possibly Some Moss\n\n**Hali:** \nWould I Be Able To Still Determine Whether Or They're Edible\n\n**Chuck:** \nYou Have A Better Shot At It Than Anybody Else Does\n\n**Chuck:** \nI Mean They're Still Similar At Least To Other Plants You've Seen Even If They're Different Species\n\n**Chuck:** \nBut So You Can You Can Go With Rules Of Thumb So\n\n**Chuck:** \nWhereas Everybody Else Is Going To Be Like Well That's That's A plant\n\n**Dave:** \nYep Rule of Thumb Touch it With Your thumb If Your thumb Itches Don't Touch that Plant Anymore\n\n**Chuck:** \nThat was Turner's Rule of Thumb?\n\n**Dave:** \nNo Turner's Rule of Thumb Was We'll Figure it Out When We're\n\n**Chuck:** \nGet Within Five Meters Of It And You Show Up At School The Next Day Covered In Calamine\n\n**Dave:** \nYeah\n\n**Jackie:** \nThat sounds familiar\n\n**Dave:** \nAnd Then There Was Uh Oh God Who Was it Seth Baker\n\n**Chuck:** \nProbably\n\n**Chuck:** \nIf It Was Stupid It Probably Was\n\n**Dave:** \nThat Every Time We Got Somewhere And He Just Made The Wrong move\n\n**Chuck:** \nYeah\n\n**Dave:** \nIsn't That Where We'll Burn That Bridge When We Get To It\n\n**Chuck:** \nProbably\n\n**Jackie:** \nSo We Wake Up In Gunton's Village\n\n**Chuck:** \nYep\n\n**Jackie:** \nAre We All Cool With That?\n\n**Dave:** \nIt's Better Not Waking Up At All\n\n**Jackie:** \nThis Is True\n\n**Jackie:** \nI Just Didn't Know If You Wanted Us To Wake Up Already Back From Said Village\n\n**Chuck:** \nNo\n\n**Chuck:** \nI Mean You
