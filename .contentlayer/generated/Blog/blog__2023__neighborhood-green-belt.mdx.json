I'm assuming blown in from the streets, maybe teens do go back there and hang out?\nI'm considering one of these days making a trip down the green belt with gloves and bags to pick up trash, something I have done\nin my neighborhood before. It’s a good walk/work out and just keeps the place clean. I'll need to get ahold of some sort of cart\nto pull with me and pick up trash to take home. Once I figure out to do that one-day I’ll post an update.\n\nAcross the street from this green belt is a really nice park that is hidden and doesn’t see too much activity.
