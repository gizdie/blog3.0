The game developers suggest to start with the set that \n includes the Barbarian and Moon Elf, as they are the easiser classes to understand.\n\nEach class has their own unique abilities that can debuff other players or buff themselves.\n Damage is determined by rolling dice and matching the dice with an ability your character has. You \n can also upgrade abilities with cards you get each turn. Active card abilities with combat points\n gained each round.\n\nWe have only played the Barbarian and Moon Elf set so far, but there may be more battles to come.\n We saw more game packages on sale at our local Barnes and Noble store. There might be another set \n purchased soon.\n\nThe game retails for about $20 on Amazon.\n\n**Other notes:**\n- Packaging is top notch - the box contains mini-boxes for each character and their \n  game accesories (dice/cards/character board)\n- The rule book is colorful and instructive\n- The artwork for the game is fun and appealing\n\n![4 out of 5 stars](/static/images/4of5stars.png)\n",
