The days of trying to make sure the Enders bed is level and checking a print job everything\nfive minutes to make sure something has not gone wrong are all gone! The Ender served its purpose and it \nwas still a great beginers 3D printer for the price it was (less than $200).\n\nOut of the box it worked and I was printing in about 15 minutes. I have a feeling I will be running out of\nfilament very often with this printer.\n\nMore complicated prints don't seem to have a problem with the P1S. There are alot of larger prints that have\nover hangs that would be printing in thin air (which does not work well on 3D printers) and they can be\ncomplicated with supports and wasteful if the print job fails. I'm still learning with this printer but I \nhave tested a more complicated print which was a full size skull mask for my face. I plan to use it for a\nHalloween costume.\n\n![Bambu Labs P1S](/static/images/blog2024/3dprints_coaster.png)\n\nI think I will start a \"snippets\" page for 3D printing and post projects I do there going forward.",
