My turkey rice bowl is ground turkey with soy sauce, and other spices. Chopped carrots\nand cabbage that have been sitting in white vingar for a hour or so. Cook the ground turkey on the stove top with the\ncarrots and cabbage, maybe a little brown surgar thrown in there. Put it over white rice, add some plain non-fat greek yourget\non top and Avacado if I have it.\n\n### December 20, 2021\nFive days until Christmas! Also getting my COVID booster on Wedensday at TCC. \n\n### December 21, 2021\nFour days until Christmas!\n\n### December 22, 2021\nThree days until Christmas! Got my Covid booster shot today. Got it done at TCC North East campus, another round of Pfizer. It was pretty open\nat TCC, no school going on and only few people in a class room getting their booster. Heading to the parents tonight\nto stay until Christmas.\n\n### December 23, 2021\nTwo days until Christmas! Over night the booster shot made me feel achey, chills, and a headache. Kind of out me out of commission half the day\ntoday. Mom made Nutcracker Sweet which is a dessert that she always made in the 90s when I was a kid. Its one of my \nfavorites. We also watched Polar Express tonight as we do every year.  \n\n![Nutcracker Sweet](/static/images/blog2021/nutcrackersweet.jpg)\n\n### December 25, 2021\nChristmas Eve we had dinner with some family friends at our house. Pretty much the same type of food we have for \nThanks Giving. I got a few nice items for my Tesla this year. Some WeatherTech floor matts, black out window shades\nfor when I go car camping. Over all was a good COVID Christmas except the fact it was still 80F outside in Texas.\n\n### Decmber 31, 2021\nJust bringning in the new year with my parents in our family friends back yard. Drinking some beer and just talked\nabout new and old music.\n\n",
