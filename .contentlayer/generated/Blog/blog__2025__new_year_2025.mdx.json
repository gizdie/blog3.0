I have\ntaken over some of the duties of a database administrator that has retired, and have currently been doing their work\nfor a few months already. Hopfully this will come with an offical title or some sort of change. Either way DBA work is a \ngreat skill for me to have under my belt. I have some knowledge already of SQL and database work but now i'm actually \ndoing the work.\n\nCurrently I have been playing STALKER 2 and Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen. Pantheon is a \"new\" old school type MMO, \ntaking the shape of 90% Ever Quest and 10% of WoW. My friend and I are currently enjoying the game but it is in \nearly access so we will see where it goes this year.\n\n### Reflect on 2024\nI started a Hobonichi Techo journal early in 2024 and tried to keep up with journaling, keeping dates, and other every day things.\nHobonichi journals are my new favorite notebook since it includes daily pages for journaling, a full monthly calandar,\nlists, and few other pages. It's also almost pocket size (A6). \n\nNow i'm starting with a new 2025 Techo journal and look forward to making my doodles and working on some of my \"art\".\nYou might start seeing my doodles on my blog. I figure it's an easy way to have icons/images that are not copy right \nor stolen. Adds some personal character to my site as well right?\n\n![2025](/static/images/blog2025/hobotechno.jpg)\n\n\n",
